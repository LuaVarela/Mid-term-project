# Mid-term-project

First project Ironhack bootcamp.
We will be using HTML/CCS/Js technologies to build a website for a fictional web design company. This includes a few pages:
a home,
a “project” page and
a contact page with a form.
Some of the challenges will be the following:
adding navigation between the pages.
making all the fields in the contact form required before being able to submit it.
(bonus) adding animations to different sections, like the “recent projects” cards.

Final result: https://63235093b3636f73bb11d2f9--melodic-taiyaki-08eba0.netlify.app/index.html 

Happy coding Let's Goooo
